<P>       Witaj! Jestes pewnie tutaj, bo zostałeś członkiem <STRONG>Polska-01</STRONG> w Star Wars Commander. Witaj w team! 
      </P>
<H2>Strategia Teamu i Polityka</H2>
<P>        We are a war squad. We're good at it because we adhere to a 
consistent team strategy. To be a Bloke, we require all members to follow said 
strategy. Teamwork is key to winning wars!       </P>
<P>        Please see our squad policies and guidelines below.       </P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <H3>Level bazy</H3>
  <P>            Please have your base's defensive capability comparable to its 
  level. Having a level 7 base with a level 5 defense is a liability we can't 
  afford. We'll usually check this when you join and let you know if your base 
  needs work.           </P>
  <P>            Your attack capability will show itself over time. Feel free to 
  ask questions though, as the team is happy to help you in becoming a 
  formidable attacker.           </P></LI>
  <LI>
  <H3>Uczestnictwo w wojnach</H3>
  <P>            In each war you have 3 attacks. You must use 
  <STRONG>every</STRONG> one of your attacks in each war. If you have doubts on 
  how to use them, ask a squad officer for tactical advice.           </P>
  <P>            Squad members that aren't using attacks will be removed.        
     </P></LI>
  <LI>
  <H3>Opting Out</H3>
  <P>            If you know that you won't be able to participate in a war, let 
  us know. We know you have a life with family, work, school, vacation, etc... 
  and won't always be available. Let an officer know so we can temporarily take 
  you off the war squad. We do this all the time and giving the heads-up is 
  appreciated!           </P></LI>
  <LI>
  <H3>Donowanie</H3>
  <P>            Jednostki donujemy zgodnie z opisem i zgłaszamy to. 
 Np. ktoś prosi o 6m, to zgłaszamy że je robimy (np. 3m xyz, gdzie xyz to nazwa gracza któremu donujesz). Wtedy nikt inny nie powinien zrobić więcej niż 3m, tak abyś ty swoje mógł danej osobie wrzucić.
Zupełnie <STRONG>nieakceptowalne</STRONG> jest wrzucanie czegokolwiek innego niż prosi o to dana osoba i grozi to <STRONG>usunięciem<STRONG> ze squadu. 
Jedyna dowolność w wrzucaniu jednostek jest gdy ktoś nie sprecyzuje co chce np. "do pełna", "byle co", czy "please send troops".
W sytuacji jak masz niepotrzebne jednostki najpierw pytamy czy ktoś je weźmie, nie dajemy byle komu aby się pozbyć. </P>
  <P><STRONG>Donacja do Sullust jest krtyczna dla wojny.</STRONG> Członej squadu powie <STRONG>dokładnie</STRONG> co jest potrzebnena Sullust. 
  Donowanie innych jednostek jest nieaakceptowanle i jest powodem do natychmiastowego usunięcia ze squadu.</P>
  <P>            Even if the squad member doesn't state a specific request for 
  Sullust defence, still be smart with donations.  Donate items like speeders, 
  snipers, or probe droids which are particularly great for war defence. Do not 
  give units like dewbacks, shock troopers, or repair droids as that'll assist 
  the enemy in grabbing more uplinks.           </P></LI>
  <LI>
  <H3>Outposty</H3>
  <P>            Outposts often dictate the tide of war. Pay close attention as 
  this is probably our most detail-oriented war tactic and can make or break the 
  team.           </P>
  <P>            When a war starts, don't start grabbing outposts. Instead, wait 
  for the opposing squad to take it first. Each outpost (op) starts as a level 5 
  base. Each time it is captured it will raise a level and become more 
  challenging to capture. Level 9 ops are the most challenging to capture.  We 
  let the opposing team take ops first so we attain them at level 9. Here's what 
  we hope will happen for all ops.           </P>
  <OL>
    <LI>Enemy grabs level 5 op which becomes level 6 on capture.</LI>
    <LI>We capture it back and the op becomes level 7.</LI>
    <LI>They take it again and it's now level 8.</LI>
    <LI>We take it, the op is now level 9 and is most difficult for the enemy to 
    capture back.</LI></OL>
  <P>            As teams start capturing bases, carefully follow these 
  guidelines</P>
  <P></P>
  <OL>
    <LI>                If an opposing team has an op, <STRONG>don't attack 
    bases</STRONG>. That's using an attack at a disadvantage. Either get the op 
    back or wait for another squad member to get it back.               </LI>
    <LI>                Capture bases comparable to your level.  If you're a 
    level 6-7, capture the level 6 base. If you're level 8, capture the level 8 
    bases. Don't force players of higher level to waste attacks on easy targets. 
                  </LI>
    <LI>                If an enemy gets one or multiple ops, work together to 
    get them back <STRONG>ASAP</STRONG>! Get them back if you can. If not, 
    donate to those who can.               </LI></OL>
  <P></P></LI>
  <LI>
  <H3>Avoid "Remove Me" Habits</H3>
  <P>            Sometimes we'll need to remove members that aren't a good fit. 
  These are the reasons for most removals.           </P>
  <OL>
    <LI>Not donating troops to other members.</LI>
    <LI>Not contributing rep points to the squad.</LI>
    <LI>Donating troop types that don't match a specific request.</LI>
    <LI>Donating bad troop types for Sullust (e.g. Shock Troopers, Repair 
    Droids, Dewbacks).</LI>
    <LI>Not following the team strategy (e.g. grabbing level 5 ops and not 
    waiting for an opponent squad to take them first).</LI>
    <LI>Being on the war squad and not using your attacks.</LI>
    <LI>Trolling the channel of being a d*ck.</LI></OL>
  <P>            Sometimes we have to remove players in bulk when we get a bunch 
  of players that have rushed bases. If that happens we mean not to offend. 
  Having rushed bases on the war squad can cause bad match-ups.           
  </P></LI>
  <LI>
  <H3>Don't be a D*ck</H3>
  <P>            The squad is full of nice, groovy people and we have to keep it 
  that way to keep things fun. We refer people to this page so that team 
  strategy is easier to understand, we're winning wars, and we all have fun! Be 
  groovy with us and please don't be a d*ck.           </P></LI></OL>
